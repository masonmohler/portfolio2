# Mason Mohler Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! Most, if not all, of the information in this document will be on my website, but I felt like it would be a good idea to write it out for people that prefer a less visual experience and want to get to the nitty gritty right away.

## About Me

I specialize in aesthetic web design and writing clean, efficient, and maintainable code. People are much more likely to interact with websites that are aesthetically pleasing and easy to navigate, so I strive to create websites that look great on any device and guide the user through the entire interaction to avoid any confusion or frustration. I approach my websites with progressive enhancement in mind; making sure that they work without any bells and whistles, but also provide an even better experience for those users that are up-to-date on all the newest technologies.
