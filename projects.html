            I led a development team to create a website for the fictional
            outfitting company Newton County Adventure Company. We used HTML and
            CSS to build out the page and style it, and then we added JavaScript
            to call an API that would allow us to get current river levels and
            flow rates for the Buffalo River.

            I created a website that allows the user to explore pictures taken
            by 3 different Mars rovers on various days. I used HTML and CSS for
            the main structure of the page, then I used JavaScript to call the
            NASA API and get photos based on the rover and date selected by the
            user.

          <p>
            NOTE: Since the creation of this website, NASA has moved the images
            for the Opportunity and Spirit rovers. The metadata for these rovers
            is still being fetched from the API, but the only rover that will
            currently display pictures in searches is the Curiosity. I have
            reached out to NASA about this and have not yet gotten a response.

            Roll Initiative is a web application I created to track combat in
            Dungeons and Dragons. It allows the user to add new players and new
            enemies and automatically sorts them by initiative. It also lets the
            user edit these players and enemies on the fly, as well as stores
            their data in their local browser storage so that they can save
            their progress.

            Spark Inventory Management is a full-stack web application I
            designed to streamline inventory management for car lots of any
            scale. Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Express.js, PostgreSQL, and
            Node.js, the system enables users to view their current inventory,
            add new cars, and delete cars. To make this possible, I created a
            PostgreSQL database hosted on Render so that I could access it
            online. Then, I created a RESTful API using Node.js and Express.js
            to communicate with the server, which I also hosted on Render,
            giving me an online endpoint I could access with my frontend.
            Finally, I created a simple front end using HTML and CSS for the
            styling and JavaScript to call the API I made. Overall, this was my
            most challenging project yet, but I feel like I learned so much
            while creating it.
          </p>
          <p>
            NOTE: Becuase I am only using the free tier of Render, my API spins
            down after periods of inactivity, so please allow 1 minute for the
            page to load initially. This is not caused by any error in code, the
            API simply takes some time to spin back up and deploy the
            information from the database. Once the page has loaded, all
            operations inside the web application will be much faster.
